This repository contains Terraform configuration to deploy a static website backed by AWS S3, the website itself written in HTML and GitHub workflow for CI/CD. The GitHub workflow will apply the configuration on push to the main branch and then upload the website HTML file to the S3 bucket; there is only one website file.

To deploy code: 
  -edit Terraform block in main.tf to use organization and workspace specific to you
  -add AWS access key ID and secret access key under GitHub environment secret names "AWS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" respectively
  -add Terraform API token under GitHub respository secret name "TF_API_TOKEN"
  -input the name of the S3 bucket under GitHub environment secret name "AWS_BUCKET"

Additional note(s):
  -the "Upload to S3" step in the GitHub workflow assumes the S3 bucket is in 'us-east-1' region, as is the default value for the respective Terraform variable
